Airline companies wants to use model to identify customers that are having a negative experience and direct tweets with negative sentiment towards the proper channel.

By implementing this system, the airline company can improve customer satisfaction by addressing negative experiences more quickly and efficiently, increase brand loyalty by showing that they value and take action on customer feedback.
